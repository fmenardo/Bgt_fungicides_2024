# Dataset
We uses the dataset <ins>Europe+</ins> from the Jigisha et al. 2024 (link). This datatset comprises 415 Bgt isolates that were sampled between 25 and 60 degree latitude North, and between -9 and 60 degree longitude.
For some analysis we used a subset of this dataset including only samples collected in 2015 or more recently (<ins>Europe+_recent</ins>). Finally we also efined a <ins>temporal<ins> dataset to investigate changes over multiple decades (see article for details). 

We use the vcf file produced by Jigisha et al. 2024 as a starting point for most of the analyses. The vcf can be downloaded [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13903934). For details about the WGS pipeline see the original repository [link](https://github.com/fmenardo/Bgt_popgen_Europe_2024/blob/Bgt_ms/WGS_pipeline/WGS_pipeline.md).

The list of all samples with metadata can be found here (link).
