# Dataset
We uses the dataset <ins>Europe+</ins> from the Jigisha et al. 2024 (link). This datatset comprises 415 Bgt isolates that were sampled between 25 and 60 degree latitude North, and between -9 and 60 degree longitude.
For some analysis we used a subset of this dataset including only samples collected in 2015 or more recently (<ins>Europe+_recent</ins>).

We use the vcf file produced by Jigisha et al. 2024 as a starting point for most of the analyses. The vcf can be downloaded here (link). For details about the WGS pipeline see the original repository (link).

The list of all samples with metadata can be found here (link).
