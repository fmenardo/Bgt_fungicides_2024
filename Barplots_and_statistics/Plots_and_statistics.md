We used the `fasta_to_variables_table.py` to extract information from protein and nucleotide FASTA files. More specifically, we extracted specific positions per gene of interest into CSV files.

This information is available in this [table](../Dataset/Minadakis_et_al_2024_Supplementary_Data_S1_rev.csv). The plot and statisticale tests were performed with`descriptive_stats_haplotypes_cyp51.R`, `fungicide_barplots.R`, `fishers_exact_test.R`, and `t_test_cyp51_CN.R`.
