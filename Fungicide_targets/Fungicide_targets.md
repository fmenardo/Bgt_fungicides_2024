# Fungicide targets

We focus on 8 known fungicides targets:

- sdhA (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. A)
- sdhB (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. B)
- sdhC (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. C)
- cyp51 (Sterol 14-demethylase)
- cytB (Cytochrome b)
- Btub (Beta tubulin)
- erg2 (C-8 sterol isomerase)
- erg24 (delta(14)-sterol reductase)

The annotation of all genes was done manually based on homology with the sequences of same genes for other fungal species and RNA-seq alignments.
The genomic coordinates for these eight genes are available as text files in this folder.
