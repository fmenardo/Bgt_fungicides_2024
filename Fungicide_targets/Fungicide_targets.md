# Fungicide targets

We focus on 6 known fungicides targets:

- sdhA (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. A)
- sdhB (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. B)
- sdcC (Succinate dehydrogenase sub. C)
- cyp51 (Sterol 14-demethylase)
- cytB (Cytochrome b)
- Btub (Beta tubulin)

The annotation of all genes was done manually based on homology with the sequences of same genes for other fungal species and RNA-seq alignments.
The genomic coordinates (add link to ref genome) for these six genes are available as text files in this folder.
