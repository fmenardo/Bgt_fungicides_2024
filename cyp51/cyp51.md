# Cyp51 coverage and alignmnent

We estimated the number of copies of cyp51 by calculating the average coverage from start to stop codon and dividing it by the genome-wide coverage.
For one isolate:
```
samtools coverage -r LR026991.1_chr8:5728014-5729706 ${filename}
```
The genome-wide covergae was obtained from (LINK)
