We used the `fasta_to_variables_table.py` to extract information from protein and nucleotide FASTA files. More specifically, we extracted specific positions per gene of interest into CSV files.

We added that information to a table [link](www.github.com/fmenardo/Bgt_fungicides_2024/Dataset/Supplementary_Data_S1) and performed the rest of the analyses using it.
